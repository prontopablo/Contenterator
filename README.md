# Contenterator/Gamerator
Website to play games against GPT-3.5. 
<br>
I built the website over a few days and soon realised the limitations of GPT-3.5 in regards to playing games. 
<br>
The website is at https://prontopablo.github.io/Contenterator/ (click "Gamerator" in the top left to visit the home page) but I am not currently paying for GPT, so it won't respond to your moves.
